# COVID-19 #PositiveVibesOnly news

A project made for the Aplicações de Código Aberto (ACA) unit course that intends to create a bot that only shows
positive news about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The thematic was inspired by the fact that we get bombarded by negative and soul-draining COVID-19 news a lot of the time,
with positive news often being overshadowed by the said negative news almost every single day. This project intends to play a role
on changing that reality and build a solid supply of positive news to be stored for eventual exposition. Google's
Cloud Natural Language API will be used to make the bot decide between positive and negative news when searching COVID-related news,
discarding the negative news and saving the positive ones.

Developers: Me and my colleague Bruno Silva.
